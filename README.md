# Library-Database-Management-System
Constructed a Library Database Management System utilizing SQLite and SQL, alongside crafting a user-friendly software interface in Python. This interface seamlessly integrates with the DBMS, enabling users to effortlessly sign in, manage profiles, return books, search the catalog, pay penalties, and log out, enhancing the overall library experience.

# Code execution guide
1. Save the provided Python code in a file. For example it can be saved as it is "system.py"
2. Make sure the system it is tested on have SQLite installed and accessible in your environment.
3. Prepare your SQLite database file or use the provided "project.db" file.
4. Open your terminal or command prompt.
5. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file and the database file.
6. Run the Python script by executing the command:
   python system.py <database_file_path>
   Replace <database_file_path> with the path to the SQL database file. If not provided, it will default to "project.db".
7. Follow the prompts in the terminal to log in, create an account, and interact with the library management system.
8. After logging in the library management system functionalities such as borrowing, returning books, viewing profiles, etc. can be used.
